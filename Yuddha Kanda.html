    <h1>Yuddha Kanda</h1>
    <p>The Yuddha Kanda, also known as the Book of War, is the sixth and final book of the Hindu epic Ramayana. This section narrates the climactic war between Lord Rama's forces and the demon king Ravana's army in the kingdom of Lanka. It begins with the construction of a bridge by Rama's vanara (monkey) army led by Hanuman, enabling them to cross the ocean and reach Lanka. The battle is fiercely fought, with numerous heroic deeds performed by both sides. Notable events include the confrontation between Rama and Ravana's generals, the death of Ravana's son Indrajit, and the crucial role played by Hanuman in retrieving the life-saving herb Sanjivani to revive Lakshmana. Ultimately, the war culminates in a final duel between Rama and Ravana, where Rama emerges victorious, slaying Ravana with his divine weapon. With Ravana's defeat, Sita is rescued, and Rama's dharma (righteousness) is upheld. The Yuddha Kanda concludes with Rama's return to Ayodhya, where he is reunited with his beloved wife Sita, marking the end of their exile and the beginning of their rule as righteous monarchs.
