    <h1>Uttara Kanda</h1>
    <p>The Uttara Kanda, the final chapter of the Ramayana, focuses on the later life of Lord Rama after his return to Ayodhya. It recounts the exile of Sita due to rumors questioning her chastity, her refuge with sage Valmiki, and the birth of Rama's twin sons, Lava and Kusha. Despite Sita's innocence being proven, she chooses to return to the earth, leaving Rama grief-stricken. The Kanda concludes with Rama's continued rule over Ayodhya, guided by the memory of his beloved wife and the principles of righteousness.</p>
