            <p>Valmiki, also known as Maharishi Valmiki, is a revered sage in Hindu tradition and the author of the epic poem Ramayana. Little is known about his early life, but he is believed to have been born as a hunter named Ratnakara. After a divine encounter with the sage Narada, he renounced his violent ways and meditated for years, attaining enlightenment. During his meditation, he received divine revelations, which formed the basis of the Ramayana.
             The Ramayana narrates the life and adventures of Lord Rama, an avatar of Lord Vishnu, and other characters such as Sita, Lakshmana, Hanuman, and Ravana. It is divided into seven books and contains approximately 24,000 verses. Valmiki's Ramayana is revered for its moral and ethical teachings, and it has profoundly influenced Indian culture and literature. Valmiki's legacy as a sage and poet continues to be celebrated, emphasizing the importance of leading a righteous life.</p>
