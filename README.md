# Tales-on-the-web
Tales on the Web is a front-end development project designed to demonstrate how a multi-page, content-rich website can be built using only client-side technologies. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to present the epic Ramayanam in a visually engaging and organized format. The website structure is modular and reusable, making it suitable for any storytelling or content-based web project.

# Model Description
This project simulates a functional static website using basic web technologies. The layout includes several HTML pages linked through a navigation bar, styled consistently with CSS, and enhanced with JavaScript for interactivity. Each section of the website focuses on a specific part of the Ramayanam, including poems, detailed story summaries (divided by Kandas), and an author biography. The design is clean and structured, allowing users to navigate easily between pages.

The JavaScript functionality is simple but purposeful — such as toggling story sections dynamically without reloading the page. Images are included on every story page to improve visual representation and context. CSS styles apply consistent fonts, colors, hover effects, layout spacing, and a fixed background image for aesthetic appeal.

This project is suitable for anyone learning front-end development and looking to showcase their ability to build a content-oriented website from scratch.

# Key Features of the Project:
• Multi-page website with navigation across Home, Poems, Stories, and Author sections.

• Static website structure using semantic HTML.

• Poems page with ancient Sanskrit verses and English meanings.

• Stories page categorized by the seven Kandas of the Ramayanam (e.g., Bala Kanda, Aranya Kanda).

• Toggle button to show/hide the story section links using JavaScript.

• Author page styled using a split-layout with text and an image side by side.

• Background image with a dark overlay for better text readability.

• Styled buttons with hover effects using CSS transitions.

• Responsive design and clean layout using modern CSS techniques.

• Centralized CSS file for maintaining consistent design across all pages.

# Tech Stack Overview
1. HTML — Structure and Content
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to define the structural foundation of the website. Each section (Home, Poems, Stories, Author, and individual Kandas) is created as a separate .html file.
Key responsibilities of HTML in this project:

     • Organizes content into headings, paragraphs, lists, and navigation.

     • Embeds images and links between pages.

     • Ensures semantic layout and logical flow for users and browsers.

2. CSS — Styling and Layout
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to design the visual presentation of the HTML content. It controls the appearance and layout of every element on the site.
Key contributions of CSS in this project:

     • Sets font styles, colors, background images, and spacing.

     • Creates interactive effects like button hover transitions.

     • Applies a dark transparent overlay on the background image for better readability.

     • Ensures a clean, responsive layout across all pages for a unified look and feel.

3. JavaScript — Interactivity
JavaScript brings interactivity to the otherwise static website. It’s used to enhance user experience by making parts of the interface dynamic.
How JavaScript is used in this project:

     • Controls the toggle functionality of the “View Stories” button on the stories.html page.

     • Shows or hides the Kanda story links dynamically without reloading the page.

     • Demonstrates basic DOM manipulation for beginner-level interactivity.

# Replication Steps
To replicate the steps and build your own version of this static website project from scratch, please follow the instructions below:
1. Website Preparation
Create your static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your project should include:

    • A main page (index.html) to serve as the homepage.

    • Additional content pages (poems.html, stories.html, author.html, and one HTML file for each Kanda section such as bala kanda.html, ayodhya kanda.html, etc.).

    • A stylesheet (styles.css) to define consistent layout, fonts, colors, buttons, background images, and responsive design.

    • A JavaScript file (main.js) to implement interactive elements like the toggle functionality on the Stories page.

    • A collection of image files (e.g., valmiki.jpeg, sundara kanda.jpeg) that support the storytelling visually.

    • Ensure that all files are organized in a single root-level project folder, for example: tales-on-the-web.

2. Environment Setup
Install the required tools on your local machine:

   •  A modern code editor such as Visual Studio Code

   •  A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
3. Project Initialization
   • An index.html file, which serves as the homepage.

   • A poems.html file for displaying poems.

   • A stories.html file for listing and accessing story sections.

   • An author.html file with information about the author.

   • Individual HTML files for each Kanda, for example: bala kanda.html, ayodhya kanda.html, etc.

   • A styles.css file containing all styling rules for layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design.

   • A main.js file containing JavaScript functions that enable interactivity, such as the toggle feature on the Stories page.

   • A folder named images that includes all image files used throughout the website. 

4. Write Your Code

   • HTML: Define semantic structure for each page using tags such as "header", "nav", "main", and "section".

   • CSS: In styles.css, style all pages consistently, including layout, background overlays, typography, navigation buttons, and responsive spacing.

   • JavaScript: In main.js, write functions like toggleStoryOptions() to show/hide sections without reloading the page.

Ensure all pages are linked through tags in the navigation and that image paths are correct.
